<p><h3>For Sellers</h3></p>
<p>We at Vita Viride believe that buyers deserve to get what they observe. If you state that your product is  approved for people who require their food to be Halal, Vegan or Vegetarian, then the packaging of the product should contain the necessary signs. In the event that the necessary signs are not present on the packaging, further action may be taken against you. If you have any queries, contact us at <u>vitavirideadmin@gmail.com</u>.</p>
