	The price of items and option items for sale will be determined by the seller at<br>
	his/her own discretion. Sellers may wish to take into consideration all relevant factors,<br>including but without limitation, Basic Fees, Option Item Fees, Shipping Charge Fees and other service fees. <br>

	and on behalf of sellers to induce transactions between buyers and sellers by reducing,<br>
	discounting or refunding Basic Fees and other service fees, or in other ways. In no event,<br>
	such adjustment of Basic Fees and other service fees will affect the originally determined<br> settlement amount payable to sellers. The final actual price that buyers will pay will be<br>
	the price that such adjustment is applied to.<br>
	For the purpose of promoting the sales of the items listed by sellers, the Company may post<br>
	such items (at adjusted price) on third-party websites (such as portal sites and price comparison<br>sites) and other websites (domestic or foreign) operated by the Company.</p><br>
