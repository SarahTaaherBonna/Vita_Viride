<p><h3>For Buyers</h3></p>
<p>We at Vita Viride believe that what you see is what you get. If a seller states that their product is  approved for people who require their food to be Halal, Vegan or Vegetarian, then the packaging of the product should contain the necessary signs. In the event that you notice the necessary signs are not present after obtaining the product, contact us at <u>vitavirideadmin@gmail.com</u>. We will look into it and take further action against the seller if necessary.</p>
